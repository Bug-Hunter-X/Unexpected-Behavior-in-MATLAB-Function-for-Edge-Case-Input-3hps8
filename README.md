This repository contains a MATLAB function demonstrating an uncommon coding error involving an edge case. The function `myFunction` has unexpected behavior when the input is exactly 10 because it is not explicitly handled in the conditional statements. This leads to the default `else` case being used, resulting in an incorrect output. The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected version with appropriate handling for the edge case input.  The issue highlights the importance of thorough testing, especially considering edge cases and boundary conditions during software development.
